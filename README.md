- :telescope: Async Microservices with RabbitMQ &amp; MassTransit involves building microservices that communicate asynchronously via RabbitMQ, a message broker, and MassTransit, a .NET messaging library.

- :telescope: This approach decouples services, improving scalability, resilience, and performance by allowing independent operation and communication through message exchanges.

- :telescope: A webhook is a way for one system to send real-time data or notifications to another system automatically whenever a specific event occurs. It's like a push notification, but for servers. Instead of constantly polling or requesting updates, a webhook waits for an event to happen (like a new order being placed), and then it triggers an action, such as sending data to another service or executing a specific function.
